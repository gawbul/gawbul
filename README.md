#### - 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

[Pathlength](https://github.com/gawbul/pathlength) a ray tracing program for calculating resolution and sensitivity in crustacean eyes (reniform reflecting superposition compound eyes).

A [comparative genomic analyses of introns](https://github.com/gawbul/fish_introns) in several species of fish using publicly available data from the [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org) genome project.

#### - 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

Trying to learn ~~too many things~~ [Go](https://golang.org), ~~all about the [Science of Exercise](https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-exercise)~~, various topics within SRE from [Google](https://sre.google) including [Site Reliability Engineering: Measuring and Managing Reliability](https://www.coursera.org/learn/site-reliability-engineering-slos#syllabus) and working towards a number of [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/) and [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/certification) certifications, utilising resources such as [Preparing for Google Cloud Certification: Cloud Engineer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/cloud-engineering-gcp). I am also interested in learning more about Data Science, Machine Learning and AI with a view to applying it to my genomics research. As part of this I am undertaking the [Genomic Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science) on Coursera.
